            <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Food is the process by which we take from outside a series of substances that are necessary for Diet and Nutrition. Those substances are found in the foods that are part of our diet.Nutrition is the set of processes by which the person ingests, absorbs, transforms, and uses substances.
            It is proven that food and health go hand in hand since a correct diet helps promote health and prevent diseases. There are many studies that link diet and chronic diseases (cardiovascular, obesity, diabetes mellitus, etc.). Demonstrating that improper eating is one of the main determining factors in the development of these diseases.The type of food we eat, as well as its quantity, have a huge influence on our health. Unfortunately, it is very easy to eat badly if you choose a diet that contains too many inappropriate foods, for example, fast foods rich in fat, and an insufficient amount of healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables.

        <h1>Defination of diet</h1>
    <p>According to most dietitians, there are no “bad” foods, but “unhealthy” diets. A healthy diet is achieved by eating the right amount of food in the right proportion, with continuity.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of Dieting</h3>
            <p>Physical: Dieting doesn’t have to be an arduous and boring fight and sometimes, supposedly lost beforehand if we are clear about our plans. If what we want is to look better physically and model our figure eliminating superfluous fat, we must be clear that the diet is not going to be torture, but the path that will lead us to achieve our goal. We have to be clear that after dieting we will be great because, if we do it well, we will achieve what we want.</p>

            <h3>Disadvantages of dieting</h3>
            <p>Physically: We all know the problems that excessively rigorous or inadequate diets can cause. There are as many diets as people who have devised and tested them or not, disclosed their use, whether they work or not. Who has not heard of a diet of artichoke, chicken breast or even the Tibetan monks of soaked rice grains? We should not allow ourselves to be guided by gossip that the only thing they are going to achieve is to harm our health.</p>
